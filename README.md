# sfml1

An initial exploration into SFML


### SFML Info

[sfml-dev.org](https://www.sfml-dev.org)

### Installing SFML

(For Mac)

Install with Homebrew:

`brew install sfml`

Likely places the include files and libs here:

`/opt/homebrew/Cellar/sfml/2.5.1_2`

Note the CMakeLists.txt refers to this location for includes, and seems to also find the libraries.

### Running

Once SFML is installed with brew, bring this project into CLion and run!
